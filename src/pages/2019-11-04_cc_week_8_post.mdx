# CC Week 8 Post

It seems like every week, the public discovers a new case of rampant data collection from another tech company—Google, Uber, ~Facebook~ FACEBOOK, it never ends. Even two years ago, much of the American public seemed blissfully ignorant of the unbelievable scale of data collection. Instagram listening through your phone’s microphone was just a conspiracy theory, right?

Nothing better exemplifies this better than the recent Zuckerberg hearing in front of the US Congress, where he gave cop-out answers and excuses to sometimes-intense questioning in front of the American people. As a viewer, it seemed like Zuckerberg was still living in a different era, one pre-Cambridge Analytica. One during which “connecting people” could justify any means, but the tide has turned.

This realization has come way too late for our industry, but as technologists, I think it’s critical that we **consider the moral & ethical implications before, during, & after** creating any piece of technology. If we’d been doing this from the beginning, standard practices & the industry’s moral conscience would look very different.

Systems that collect no user data are often way less useful—but it doesn’t have to be this way. Apps can run locally and collect only basic analytics, not just be all-seeing web services.
