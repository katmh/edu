## Behind the scenes: shareable image profiles

_Cross-posted to [notebook.lachlanjc.me](https://notebook.lachlanjc.me/2019-12-11_shareable_profiles_for_gun_funded/)_

![A grid of 4 examples of the social cards](https://d2wkqk610zk1ag.cloudfront.net/items/1u1c1M1j0L2B04082U3O/30jf53wht60447457zcr123c7maehrp4.png)

Sharing links to Congresspeople‚Äôs profiles on Twitter, Facebook, etc, I wanted to highlight the gun funding amount before people even open the site. But I also wanted the profiles to be shareable on Instagram Stories (for us youths), which requires a vertical format (as seen on the left & right). Here‚Äôs how I made the social cards service.

### Avatars

Before we can get to the cards, each Congress member needs an avatar.

The [unitedstates.io](https://theunitedstates.io/) project has the [unitedstates/images](https://github.com/unitedstates/images) archive on GitHub, but it‚Äôs unfortunately out of date. [Someone forked it](https://github.com/SeanKMcGinnis/images) with updates, then I [added](https://github.com/SeanKMcGinnis/images/pull/1) a few missing members.

Next, I wanted to compress the images (they‚Äôre also used on the main website, where Google PageSpeed flagged their extra size as slowing down the site). I wrote a quick Bash script to run Google‚Äôs fantastic [Guetzli](http://github.com/google/guetzli) image compressing library on the folder. (There‚Äôs probably a better way to do this, but I‚Äôm terrible at Bash.)

```sh
#!/bin/bash

for file in $@
do
  guetzli $file $file
done
```

It took about half an hour & drained half my laptop‚Äôs battery, fans up 100% üòÖ

#### Getting online

I‚Äôve been using & loving [ZEIT Now](https://now.sh) for the main Gun Funded site, so I deployed the static folder to a new Now project:

![Hyper terminal window open running now](https://d2wkqk610zk1ag.cloudfront.net/items/2Y3j37001L0k1h0f0B3Q/zq6d83r41hxve1u92t244awm6vtec8qh.png)

One more command (`now alias gunfunded-avatars.now.sh avatars.gunfunded.com`) and our images are live!

#### The lineup, visually

I wrote a quick iOS Shortcut to get the headshots of every member of Congress, ranked by their gun funding, & create a grid of them all:

![Shortcut on vertical iPad Pro](https://d2wkqk610zk1ag.cloudfront.net/items/202V2Q3N310G2j3G3x2H/7qkvtky698dtbbk4zwr1cr3qubucd57c.png)

It took a few minutes to run, since it has to download hundreds of photos individually, but here‚Äôs the result:

![Grid of every Congressperson‚Äôs portraits](https://d2wkqk610zk1ag.cloudfront.net/items/351W0P230F3F102R0t20/pb0az1r8xagu1wj021dvcbyugm80xzyf.jpeg)

Yes, Congress is that white.

### Social cards

Back to the original mission. I‚Äôve written in the past about [making custom social card services](https://notebook.lachlanjc.me/2019-11-05_custom_social_card_services/) based on [ZEIT‚Äôs og-image](https://github.com/zeit/og-image), but this project is more complicated.

- I need to fetch data from the Gun Funded records database, to show funding
- I need to change styling based on the data
- I want variants for Twitter/Facebook/Open Graph social cards as well as vertical Instagram Stories

I cloned my [ima-cards](https://github.com/lachlanjc/ima-cards) project, and removed [the web testing UI](https://ima-cards.lachlanjc.now.sh) code to simplify development.

The development process took several hours but wasn‚Äôt too hard--mostly, I don‚Äôt have much experience using TypeScript, but running the project with [`now dev`](https://zeit.co/blog/now-dev) was great. I copied the full data JSON file directly over, then worked on the design.

![Editing the template TypeScript file in VSCode on a MacBook Pro](https://d2wkqk610zk1ag.cloudfront.net/items/040A3L3H2H0G3v1N200h/ehp65gdmc7knyf0e90v5ch53wrr4nk20.png)

The design references the "I Voted" stickers, but with the brand, candidate, and funding amount. For Instagram Stories, I used the Instagram handle (@gunfunded), whereas on the web it uses the domain (gunfunded.com). With the Stories‚Äô extra vertical space, it also shows the current term of the Congressperson.

I copied the same color palette as the site to keep the vibe/brand consistent. Though the site uses San Francisco/system-ui for typography, the incredible [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) font stepped in here.

Deployment was just as easy as for Avatars--just `now` & `now alias` to `cards.gunfunded.com`.

#### End results

Whether for Representatives or Senators, funded or not funded, Republican or Democrat, Instagram or Twitter, cards for all!

</CommitList>

Did user testing in class today. People really liked the site, especially the design, though were confused about some of the stats on profiles as well as how to navigate the site. Based on people‚Äôs feedback & my observations, I made a checklist of improvements to make to the site:

- [ ] Add navigation on state pages
- [x] State link on profile pages is broken
- [x] Whole profile card should link to profile page
- [ ] Tooltips/asterisk to add explanation to opposition/support stats on profiles
- [x] Fix stats on mobile
- [x] Change ‚ÄúShare‚Äù to ‚ÄúMore‚Äù
- [x] Color More button based on party?
- [x] Fix Instagram links: remove @ sign
- [x] Add label for Contact section
- [x] Form icon is unclear
- [x] Add Search card to end of states pages
- [x] Add party breakdown on states pages
- [ ] Add About page
- [x] Add description on homepage
- [x] Remove WebKit highlights from states on homepage cards
- [ ] Clarify PACs page description
- [ ] Better navigation across the site
- [x] Titles on profile pages
- [x] On state pages, separate Senators from Representatives
