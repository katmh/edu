# CC – Final Project Check-in

I’m making great progress on [**Gun Funded**](https://gunfunded-git-glitch.lachlanjc.now.sh/).

- Data is scraped & compiled, final database is ready
- Workflow is established
- Theme/styling is mostly finalized
- Profile components are mostly built out
- Search is working, based on my [Week 10 Project](https://ima.lachlanjc.me/2019-11-10_cc_week_10_project/) but revamped to integrate with the new database

## Still to build

- Search experience revamp
- Sharing workflow
- Individual profile pages
- New homepage navigation
- Filtering UI?
- About page
- Data visualizations
