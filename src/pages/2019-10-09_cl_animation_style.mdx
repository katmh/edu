# CL â€“ ðŸŒŸ Animation Style

One film with an animation style I respect deeply is Wallâ€¢E. Each segment of the film takes place in a drastically different environmentâ€”first the post-apocalyptic, trash-heaped remains of Earth, then a robot-filled gleaming starship, and finally the recovering earthâ€”and the animators render the very different worlds with unique styles.

The meticulous animation style Pixar is famous for extends to Wallâ€¢E, too. Every prop, scene, and character exudes the vibe of the setting with care and detail, and fans took note. While they could have been simplified and overlooked, the excruciatingly-intricate details add a depth to the animation that animators of all styles should aspire to.

My favorite part of the animation in Wallâ€¢E, though, is the way itâ€™s used to tell just a deeply prescient and compelling story. The shockingly-emotional relationship we see the title character and EVE form is told entirely without words, and instead through the body language of two robots. The animators utilize all of Wallâ€¢Eâ€™s limbs & robotic features to show (and never tell) his feelings with nuance. The eyes on both characters deserve a special shoutout for the way they each exude character, telling stories with striking emotional character through relatively simple shapes and maneuvers.

Over a decade following its release, society has not taken note of its warnings whatsoever. But Wallâ€¢E nonetheless remains, in my mind, an animated masterpiece. The depth of detail in every scene, particularly the emotive stories told by the main charactersâ€™ robot bodies, would stand absolutely alone if not for much of Pixarâ€™s other work. The film tells a unique story through gorgeous animation and its storytelling should be admired for a long time to come.
