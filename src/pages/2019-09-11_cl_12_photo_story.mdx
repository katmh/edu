## Update

After making & publishing this story, my dad mentioned the artist David Hammons, specifically his work [Phat Free](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/185068/phat-free), which is a video project including a man kicking a can down a road, commenting on the realities of being black & poor in the US.

While I didn’t have this work in mind while creating my story, it’s interesting to see other artists with a similar idea, though remarkably different execution & message.
