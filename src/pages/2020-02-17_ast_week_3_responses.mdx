## [The Cost of Accessibility](https://gay.medium.com/the-cost-of-accessibility-fba3b2592048)

Disability often means a reduction to pay that intersects with the reduction to pay that can come from being a woman or gender minority and/or being a person of color. On top of that, everyday-necessity services for people with disabilities mean higher costs:

It’s no secret that health insurance in the U.S. is a disaster with sometimes-lethal consequences for ~98% of the population (as [this story horrifyingly details](https://www.gq.com/story/unfunded-medical-gofundme)), but the savior that Medicaid should be often prevents people with disabilities from escaping it:

> I am thankful to be on Medicaid, but it’s a poverty trap that unfairly penalizes disabled people who want the opportunity to work, own property, and have assets like any other person.

This looks like an awesome program, started at the University of Delaware. As makers & technologists we have so many skills we can bring to the table making tools  & solutions for people with disabilities.

Back in 2017 I made a project called [Blink](https://blink.care/) at the UPenn hackathon, PennApps, with a team. For $20 in parts we built a communication hardware & software system with 3D printing, aluminum foil, an Arduino, & some basic sensors. Here’s a video showing it in action:

Great design is accessible, but sometimes bringing great design to accessibility is even more powerful. As designers, makers, & engineers we have a responsibility to do both.
