For this project, inspired by [the Figma ice cream truck](https://twitter.com/lachlanjc/status/1572307345115598854) this week, I used Figma. Though I’ve used Figma for both visual design & product UI for years, I’d never tried any of its prototyping or animation features, so I’m happy to have added their basics to my creative toolbox.
