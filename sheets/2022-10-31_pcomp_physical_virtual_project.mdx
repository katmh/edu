# Physical Virtual Project

## 2022-11-05: Almost there

I nearly finished the software today! The core game mechanic wasn’t there before—you could run out of water, but there was no constraining force on your budget, which is a key aspect of the commentary. Thus, I added a budget that changes alongside your hydration level, giving you consistent income that’s just never enough to live long. I played a bunch with the numbers, and the game may be too hard, as a typical run is around 2 days in the game. The price of water in this simulation is random, though I’m starting it at an outrageous $24.

I modified the “game over” screen to have two outcomes: dehydration & bankruptcy, which an automated voice alerts you gleefully. (I’ve got a bug where it repeats this on loop instead of allowing you to play again; to fix tomorrow.)

While the original idea called for hydration status LEDs, with the introduction of the budget concept in the software, reading 3 separate numbers aloud will be more confusing & frustrating to interact with than intriguing commentary; if you’re already looking at the screen, having status LEDs isn’t relevant. This cuts scope from the physical aspect of the project, unfortunately.

For the physical control, I need a glorified button. I want a physical water bottle on a platform you pick up to purchase water, then set back down. I got a [read switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_switch) for this project, and an accompanying magnet to put in a small plastic water bottle I was given recently. I wired up the read switch on my breadboard & wrote a tiny program to output its value to test the interaction with the water bottle.

I want the sensor to be hidden inside a cardboard(?) platform, and Priyanka helped me think through how to wire that: solder each end to a long wire (reused from my [interactive object](/2022-09-28_pcomp_interactive_object_project)), heatshrink both joints to prevent interference inside the platform, then connect both ends to the breadboard. I soldered, covered the joints, cut two squares of cardboard, & then taped the wiring down.

Luckily, the magnet is strong enough to work fine, even with the water bottle full of water, through the plastic and cardboard. I found it triggered events decently reliably when I picked up the water bottle, but there was a lot of noise in the sensor readings, which would result in perishing in the game. I followed the [Arduino Debounce tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Debounce) to not trigger events in quick succession:

```cpp
int buttonState;
int lastButtonState = HIGH;

unsigned long lastDebounceTime = 0;
unsigned long debounceDelay = 50;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(100);
  while(Serial == false){};
  pinMode(2, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
  int reading = digitalRead(2);

  if (reading != lastButtonState) {
    lastDebounceTime = millis();
  }
 
  if ((millis() - lastDebounceTime) > debounceDelay) {
    if (reading != buttonState) {
      buttonState = reading;
      Serial.println(reading);
      if (reading == LOW) {
        Serial.println("buy");
      }
    }
  }

  lastButtonState = reading;
}
```

I added serial communication to the game, which is not yet working for reasons I can’t discover through any debugging means I tried for an hour. I might try a wholly different serial library; it’s essential this works.

At the end of today, the project is *close*, with the Arduino firing off buy events and the software listening for them & responding correctly, the link just isn’t working, which is frustrating.

## 2022-11-03: Game underway!

I haven’t started on the physical components yet, but I’ve got much of the basics in place for the software. It’s a p5 sketch that I’m running with the spacebar instead of a physical controller while I test it. I’ve got a fluctuating price for the water and a hydration level out of 4 (since humans, generously, need 4 liters of water a day). There’s one UI detail I like, where when you’re on your last bottle of water, it shakes in place.

## 2022-10-31: Idea

Background: The world has a limited supply & increasing demand for potable freshwater. Long-term, renewable energy will make electricity cheap & abundant, and we’ll scale industrial-scale desalination alongside rain harvesting, toilet-to-tap, and other technologies to provide the water supply we need. But before those plants come online & while it’s prohibitively expensive—particularly in regions with conflict & not a lot of high-tech infrastructure—and as more unpredictable, intense droughts strike areas around the earth, there will be conflict & rising prices on fresh water.

My project imagines life in a drought-stricken place a decade from now, in 2032, where water has become scarce & expensive, through a callous commentary on how we treat each other. The price of water will rapidly fluctuate, and you have to decide when to buy it, but you’ll always get screwed by the rising/fluctuating prices. The player of this game will not be able to see the screen, but only get audio feedback & have the physical components in-hand, while the audience will see the screen & watch the player.

The p5 sketch:

- Shows the current price of water as it rapidly changes
- Announces the new price every few seconds with Web Speech, not explicitly stating the change but relying on the player to mentally diff the price & decide if now is a good time to buy
    - The price will change faster than announced, commenting on the poor digital infrastructure we expect from the government/institutions
- Shows the audience how much the player has bought of what they need before they dehydrate

The physical components:

- A “button” (potentially made of a water bottle with a force(?) sensor inside it) for buying water
- Communicates with the p5 sketch for input & output
- Status LEDs showing how much of the necessary water is purchased
