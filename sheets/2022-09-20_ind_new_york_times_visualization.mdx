# Week 2 – New York Times visualization

In August, after President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, the NYTimes made [a visualization of the budget changes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/13/upshot/whats-in-the-democrats-climate-health-bill.html) the law puts into place. It groups the changes into two categories: spending & tax cuts, then savings & new revenue. It uses what I would call a clustered bubble chart but is technically a [“clustered force layout”](https://datavizproject.com/data-type/clustered-force-layout/) to then visualize, to scale, the funding amounts in each category, with labels on all but the smallest circles. (In the digital version, the small circles can be hovered to view their label & funding change with a tooltip.) Across both types of spending changes, the circles are categorized with pastel background colors for taxes, energy & climate, & health care.

Below the visualization, which lets viewers quickly understand the largest changes in a few seconds, there’s a table with every line item & the amount, for more careful comparison. This table is excellent, as the category dividers, clear rhythm, & easy-to-read typography make understanding the granular changes easy. The article follows, adding journalistic context to the visualization. Further down, a third table compares the changes across categories to Biden’s originally-proposed Build Back Better plan. This table feels the least attended-to, design-wise: subtle color coding or iconography would aid the comparison.
