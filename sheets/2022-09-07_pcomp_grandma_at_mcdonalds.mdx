# Grandma at McDonald’s

Watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BzqctRGgaU) is an eye-opening experience as a designer. No doubt the intention of the wide range of hardware engineers, product designers, salespeople, & many others was good in building an order kiosk for their restaurants; that doesn’t mean the experience ends up working equally well for everyone.

One issue that’s glaringly obvious is how this grandma keeps mentioning the text is too small to read. That’s inexcusable. No one ever complains text in a UI is too large, so when making an interface for the public, that’s table stakes usability work.

Then there’s myriad other usability issues: paying, the workflow of ordering & how the food is expected to be served, etc.
