# Midterm presentation classmate question

> Olivia: Your idea of a website is great but it seems like it would be A LOT to create a full website. How do you plan on regulating the amount of work you do and the information on the website?

It is a lot! I spend an enormous number of hours making my websites—while I sometimes compress those hours into too-few days, there’s no getting around that like any other substantial piece of art, dozens of hours have to go in. Looking back at [my best projects from 2020](https://2020-sites.lachlanjc.com/), the majority were similarly substantial.

In 2020 I wrote [Production Value Changes the Product](https://notebook.lachlanjc.com/2020-12-25_production_value_changes_the_product), about my constant battle with ever-increasing personal standards for my work. (The piece is more technical than necessary; I wrote it in a different context.) As I’ve done larger projects of higher quality over the years, I hesitate to do smaller, more throwaway projects because it can feel like I’m not moving forward, not doing constantly bigger & better things. This is a mental trap: if you exclusively scale up projects, you end up skipping the vital part of the creative process that is small-scale experimentation. Big-budget, multi-year, or high-end work has its place, but some projects should be explored for a few hours to exercise your brain. For this project, it should land somewhere in between: I’m spending substantial effort on each of the research, thinking, execution, & iteration stages of it, but it’s within the scope of limited weeks & not the sole focus of my life like a full-time work project would be.

The primary balancing strategy for scoping [this project](/2022-10-28_gw_midterm_project_presentation) is limiting its subject matter coverage without compromising its form. I previously wrote: _It doesn’t need to—it can’t—capture nearly everything, so I’ll zoom into a few specific areas. Transportation & energy are ones I intend to focus on, as I think our mindset could shift in unexpected ways with wholly new systems in those areas._ 

Similar to the world an excellent musical single can create in 3 minutes through its production & the energy of vocal delivery & other aspects, I’m striving to make a project covering a few aspects of our future world with an energy that gives a compelling sense of vision covering more than it discusses. Balancing length & depth & time spent on a project never becomes easy no matter how much you work on it, but scoping is the essential force to get a creative project to a publishable endpoint.
