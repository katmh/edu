# Final project

For my final project, I wanted to tell a story that’s about data & numbers, & one that brings me great optimism for the future of climate solutions: solar power. The price of photovoltaic solar has come down 99% in the last 4 decades, 90% in the last decade, & many experts expect that trend to continue. This trend is dramatic enough a few numbers don’t tell the story, so I wanted to illustrate them.

Right now direct air capture (DAC), for sucking carbon emissions out of the atmosphere to sequester them back in the ground, costs $600/ton, whereas low-quality carbon offsets can cost $5/ton—if DAC dropped in price by the same 99% while making efficiency gains similar to solar, it’d be cheaper than bad offsets. DAC is one of many technologies we need *many orders of magnitude* more of, while improving its performance; there’s also lithium-ion batteries, water electrolyzers for energy storage through green hydrogen, heat pumps for heating & cooling, merely for the electrification arm of solving climate change, plus low-carbon industrial processes, new agricultural technologies, and more forms of carbon removal.

I did key research & got the chart data for most charts on Solar Optimism from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth), which was spectacularly helpful. I made the website using React & Next.js, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/) for most charts, [visx](https://airbnb.io/visx/) for the map, and [Framer Motion](https://framer.com/motion) for the animations. It’s designed for viewing on a widescreen (desktop/tablet) computer.
