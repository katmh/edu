# Week 1: Switch – Notebook

As a very young child, ages 1–2, I was fascinated by electrical switches of all kinds. I would turn on lights, fans, lamps, & anything else connected to a switch, for hours, just for the fun of it. My mom reports that before I could speak, I had a “word,” “Aa-taa,” which seemed to mean “turn on or off the switch.” My parents would hold me up to the switch, & I’d flip it while watching the light/fan. Apparently, not yet being able to make things happen on my own, I liked making something happen with the switch.

My interest in switches didn’t stop, apparently. Let’s build a switch!

## Building the basic switch

Plugging the power cable into my iPad, & it works! Touch the wires together, & lo & behold:

## Prior art

Two years ago, in September 2017, I attended [PennApps](https://pennapps.com), a 48-hour hackathon for high school & college students. With a team of 3 others, I helped build [Blink](https://blink.care), a hardware + software medical product to assist people who are locked-in (can’t move body parts, though oftentimes still have control of their eyes). While existing communication devices exist, they rely on expensive equipment, are often not covered by insurance, & cost $20k+.

Blink cost $20 to make. At its core, it’s similar to this project, with a piece of foil (conductive) wrapped around an electrical sensor, hooked onto a hat with a custom 3D-printed mount, connected to an Arduino. As the wearer blinks, the switch is turned on & off. We wrote a Python server to interpret the blinks as Morse code, then I designed a React/[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app to [show the results live](https://blink.now.sh), like for a caretaker or family member using an iPad.

Here’s a video demo of the project: (made at 1am after nearly no sleep for two days so excuse the cringiness)

Surprisingly, the project won the Best of Health category award & a $1k grant at the event. Unfortunately, producing hardware in bulk is incredibly difficult & expensive, & our team hasn’t pushed the project very meaningfully forward since the event.

It does prove, however, that a very simple contraption—the hardware was barely more complex than this assignment—can be used incredibly meaningfully. It’s all about the application.

## Creative application

It’s time to apply this switch to something new—more relevant to my daily life.

I wish I journaled more. Taking a few minutes to write in my notebook about what I’m thinking about—just for me, not for an online audience—is something I don’t do often enough. The first step of writing in my journal is just opening my notebook:

![Opening my notebook](https://cdn.glitch.com/88875449-2775-45de-b608-0c258718185e%2F2019-09-07_notebook.gif?v=1567832312421)

What about hooking the switch up to my notebook? When the notebook is closed, the wires will touch, then when I open the notebook, the wires will separate.

Connected to software, we could add the dimension of time, tracking what days I open Notebook & how many times.

Connected to a Node server/database & a simple visualization on a website, I could make a public tracker of my journaling habit, akin to [GitHub profiles’ contribution graphs](https://github.com/lachlanjc):

Let’s get started!

### Iteration 1

I need to connect these wires to the notebook, preferably without buying anything. Opening my desk drawer, I grab some Scotch tape, & connect the wires to the inside cover & first page. (I’m using a blank notebook to avoid publishing my real one!)

![Wires connected to the notebook](https://cdn.glitch.com/88875449-2775-45de-b608-0c258718185e%2F2019-09-07_dual.jpeg?v=1567832332151)

Trying it out…

![Opening my notebook now changes the LED’s status](https://cdn.glitch.com/88875449-2775-45de-b608-0c258718185e%2F2019-09-07_demo_2.gif)

Well that’s a good start! Though it sounds simple, this operation took about 10 minutes. Look no farther than the first frame of the animation to see a critical flaw:

![The wires don’t always touch](https://cdn.glitch.com/88875449-2775-45de-b608-0c258718185e%2F2019-09-07_problem.jpeg)

The wires are small & firm, the tape is loose & not very adherent, & most of the time, the wires don’t touch one another. The tape kept coming off, & positioning the wires with the same inset on both sides is difficult. This isn’t going to work.

### Iteration 2

I got a piece of foil! From a friend who has a kitchen :) & cut off two pieces. Also upgraded to a larger journal that stays flat/closes more tightly so that’s not such an issue for this round.

First attempt here was the add “contacts” to the same spots as I used on the previous notebook. I cut two small pieces of foil:

![Cutting the foil](https://cdn.glitch.com/88875449-2775-45de-b608-0c258718185e%2F2019-09-08_cut_foil-2.jpeg?v=1567998546802)

At first I taped over the contacts to adhere the foil, before realizing this defeated the whole project. Properly adhering them didn’t work at all either—the strong wires ripped through the foil.

![Torn foil](https://cdn.glitch.com/88875449-2775-45de-b608-0c258718185e%2F2019-09-08_torn_foil.jpeg?v=1567998606513)

I started considering ways to snake the wires through the notebook before making the realization they could both be close to the spine, sharing one piece of foil, more reliably. I braided the cables together to increase stability:

Iteration 2 completed:

![It’s working!](https://cdn.glitch.com/88875449-2775-45de-b608-0c258718185e%2F08EB055D-186F-4211-B398-BD9F87CD5B13.jpeg?v=1567998383779)

Working, mostly! It’s got a not-insignificant failure/false positive rate, but definitely functional.

With that, the project is finished! We’ve successfully made how often I write in my journal computationally accessible. We’ll need to hook up the Arduino to a piece of software to make the automated habit tracking software, but we’ve got the hardware side down.
